# Programmer, can be changed to several interfaces
# Standard will be the STLink interface as this is the standard for STM32 dev boards
# Use modern ST-Link config and explicitly select SWD transport
source [find interface/stlink.cfg]
transport select swd
# Conservative adapter speed and reset config to improve attach reliability
adapter speed 1000
# Many Blue Pill boards lack SRST wired; use software reset
